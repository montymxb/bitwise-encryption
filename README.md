bitwise-encryption
==================

Encrypt &amp; Decrypt files through XOR with a randomly generated key.

This project is license free! It's only a simple wrapper around basic XOR encryption.


Included in this project:

-Simple shell build file

-Main file in /src folder


To use this project:

-Make your changes to the .java in the /src folder

-Run ./build.sh (you may have to run `chmod a+x build.sh` first to give it permissions)

-Voila! A new executable jar will be run and made available in the /jar directory.


BitWise operations are a very neat (and powerful) addition to anyone's repertoire.
Please feel free to use this as a resource to learn, or modify it for your own personal use to create near unbreakable encryption.

Enjoy!
